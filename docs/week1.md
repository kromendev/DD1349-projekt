### Idea 1: Word typing videogame

The idea here is a game where you fight monsters by typing words. Imagine a monster running at you with a word over their head and you have to type the word before he gets near enough to damage you. Preliminarily we want this to be a level based game with 2d graphics. For this project we may only make 1 level due to time press.

### Idea 2: Music player

If you use spotify and have ever tried for example downloading a remix from youtube and tried to get it on spotify so you could play it through there, you would know that this process is not very user friendly. We want to make a music player with a simple user friendly design that lets you add music files and play it through the app. Then ofcourse add features like shuffle and creating playlists.
